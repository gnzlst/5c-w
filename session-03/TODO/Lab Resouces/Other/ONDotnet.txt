<b>Using SQL Cache Dependency</b><br />

<p>Caching has long been recognized as one of the more effective 
ways to improve your ASP.NET web applications. However, one 
particular caching feature that was dearly missing in ASP.NET 1.x 
was SQL cache dependency. SQL cache dependency is the ability to 
invalidate a database cache if data in a table is changed. In 
ASP.NET 2.0, Microsoft has, much to the joy of developers, added 
the new SQL cache dependency feature. In this article, I will 
discuss SQL cache dependency in ASP.NET 2.0, as well as discuss 
how you can manually implement your own SQL cache dependency in 
ASP.NET 1.x. </p>

<b>SQL Cache Dependency in ASP.NET 2.0</b>
<p>To illustrate SQL cache dependency in ASP.NET 2.0, let's first 
create a new web application. I have populated the default.aspx 
web form with two controls: SqlDataSource and GridView (see Figure
 1). </p>
